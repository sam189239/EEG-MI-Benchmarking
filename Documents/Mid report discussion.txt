Expectations for the mid report

Current research ideas
- Preprocessing options
- Embedding options
- Model options
	- Published works
	- General approaches to EEG classification
- Robustness to noise and artificial data

Current progress:
- Literature survey
- Collected current works on all this and
made a specific list on available options
for the benchmark and other research ideas
- Looked into data and studied its structure

Expectations for a benchmark analysis

Replication of previous work results?
Is it sufficient to study general approaches with 
other embedding and preprocessing and just include
results from the previous works directly?
